# mp3-tagging-script
Bash script to update metadata for MP3 files.

Manually tagging music for local files is very annoying so I made this script.
Intended for single MP3 files. When the time comes, I will make a script to tag entire albums.

Dependencies: Requires the ID3v2 CLI tool for modifying MP3 metadata

If you are using Homebrew for macOS, install it with:
```bash
brew install id3v2
```
